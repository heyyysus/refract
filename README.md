## Overview


![alt text](poster.png)

Refract is a cutting-edge tool designed to cloak photos of individuals, safeguarding them against:
- Unauthorized training for deepfakes.
- Facial recognition systems.
- Other harmful forms of identity theft.

Our approach involves subtly altering images at the feature level to disrupt the ability of image-processing models to identify individuals. Refract ensures these changes are:
- **Human imperceptible**: Visual differences are nearly undetectable.
- **Highly effective**: Alters feature-identifying capabilities of image-processing models.

With Refract, individuals can confidently upload photos to social media, mitigating the risks associated with facial recognition technologies, identity theft, and deepfake generators.

## How It Works

1. **Target Image Selection**: Refract identifies a target image similar to the input photo.
2. **Feature Space Alteration**: 
   - Introduces subtle changes to the original image to match the target photoâ€™s feature space.
   - Alternatively, modifies the input photo to maximize changes in its own feature space.
3. **Visual Consistency**: The final image retains strong visual similarity to the original photo while disrupting model-identifying capabilities.

## Features
- **Multiple Iterations**: Experimented with five model iterations, refining the process for optimal results.
- **User Customization**: A demo frontend includes sliders for adjusting:
  - Cloak strength.
  - Other parameters for balancing safety and visual distortion.
- **Alternative Methods**: Explored approaches including:
  - Altering the feature space of the source image itself.
  - Mimicking the feature space of a similar-looking target image.
